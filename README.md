This depository contains six different matlab file.
deviation: This file reads dcd files and calculates magnitude of each coordinates for each time step. It needs to be run before calculating exact anisotropic, multivariate Gaussian, exact isotropic and Gaussian isotropic mutual information.
MIsinglet: This file is necessary for calculation of anisotropic mutual information. It calculates distribution of magnitude of fluctuations for single residues.
MIexact_an: This code estimates anisotropic mutual information.
gaussian: This code calculates both multivariate Gaussian and Gaussian isotropic mutual information.
MIexact_is: This code calculates exact isotropic mutual information.
MI: This function is used in calculation of exact isotropic mutual information.
